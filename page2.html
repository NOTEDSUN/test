    <p>
      Although this arrangement is considered "typical", plant species show a
      wide variation in floral structure.[16] The four main parts of a flower
      are generally defined by their positions on the receptacle and not by
      their function. Many flowers lack some parts or parts may be modified into
      other functions or look like what is typically another part.[17] In some
      families, such as the grasses, the petals are greatly reduced; in many
      species, the sepals are colorful and petal-like. Other flowers have
      modified petal-like stamens; the double flowers of peonies and roses are
      mostly petaloid stamens.[18]
